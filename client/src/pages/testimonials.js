                    <h3>Loki, formerly named hiddlesten</h3>
                    <p>His new mom, Julia, writes, “We adopted Loki two years ago.
                    He had been in the shelter for months, returned twice, and he had so many allergies.
                    Their loss was our gain. He is the best boy. So sweet and kind, and while he gets anxious around new people sometimes,
                    he’s teachable and adjusts so well. My kids love him, everyone who meets him loves him, and he has mastered the art of looking
                    pathetic to gain lap access. I encourage everyone who adopts to give it time for families and dogs to adjust – it’s so worth it.
                    Loki was the perfect addition to our family and we wouldn’t be the same without him.”

                    <h3>Liesl, formerly named Heidi</h3>
                    <p>Her new mom, Shelley, writes, “Liesl had come into B-A-C with 10 cats. We were familiar with adopting a momma cat as that is what
                    Lucy was when she arrived at B-A-C. The minute I met Liesl, I knew she was meant to be with us. Her sweet face and gentleness touched
                    my heart. Liesl has brought life and energy back to our home! She is affectionate, sensitive, gentle, sweet, dear, smart, quirky,
                    spunky, a total lovebug and a wonderful companion for our 6 year old black Dobie, Gertie. She touches our hearts and makes us smile
                    every day. We are so fortunate to have Liesl in our family. We love this girl!!! “

                    <h3>Cordelia</h3>
                    <p>Her new mom, Tonya, writes, “I lost my cat two and a half years ago and I was heartbroken and couldn’t bring myself to get another one.
                    My heart started to open and with working at an animal emergency clinic I was given ample opportunities but just wasn’t quite ready.
                    Until Cordelia. She came in as a stray potentially hit by a car. She wasn’t in too bad of shape but she was eating people due to
                    being so terrified. I was drawn to her and took it slow. It didn’t take her long to let me hold her and take her outside. She was at our
                    clinic for a few days and then with a heavy heart I let her go to the humane society (as I whispered in her ear my promise to come to get her),
                    I wanted to give her family ample chance to find her. But after a week and no one calling for her, I wasted no time in picking her up. She is now my
                    little hiker, napper, cuddler, perfect little companion. My heart is so full and I thank B-A-C Campus for Compassion in taking such
                    great care of her and giving me updates when I continuously called to check on her.”

                    <p>Her new mom, Nora, writes, “My little Monroe is my little baby! She loves to play and run around, but most of all she’s her adopted little brother and sister,
                    Lady Bird. All three love each other, I love my babies Monroe, Rowdy and Lady “

                    <h3>Asher, formerly named Garrett</h3>
                    <p>His new mom, Sophia, writes, “When I finally was able to start looking for a pet I only intended on looking not rescuing right away. I made an appointment and went in on Friday,
                    August 28th. I actually came to my appointment looking at a different cat and just happened to ask if there were any grey cats. They brought in Asher. He was shy but immediately
                    ran into my lap and started to purr. I knew he was the one and took him home that day. From that day on I have loved him more than anything. He is my favorite thing to come home to every day.
                    He loves to play and I have stairs so he loves to run up and down the stairs. He truly is a blessing.”
